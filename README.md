# Object Oriented Pipeline for Machine Learning (Classification)

The **`artifacts/`**: folder is the central location where all outputs of the project, including logs and trained models, are stored. 

- **logs/**:  
  This folder stores all the log files generated during model training and evaluation. Each log file is named based on the model name and the date it was created. 
- **models/**:  
  This folder contains all the trained models. Each model is saved with a filename that includes the model name and the date it was created. This helps in versioning and identifying models based on when they were generated.
